# Vid Pipeline

A quick script to copy videos into folders organized by date and place of the form:

`[year]/[month]-[day] [place], [place]...`

After this itâ€™s ready to be synced with something like Google Photos. The script was inspired by [Elodie](https://github.com/jmathai/elodie), but not nearly as capable.
